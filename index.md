A fully open-source application bundle set for tracking location of assets with a Do-It-Yourself approach in mind. That means that you need some technical expertise to set up the Firebase Project which will host all your collected and provisioned data. This way the creator won't process or deal with any data and you can be in full control about how you manage your data and your project. For details see the tutorial below or take a look at the Git source repositories.

*Due to the DIY nature and open sourceness the creator is not responsible for any problems or damage caused by the app suite.*
