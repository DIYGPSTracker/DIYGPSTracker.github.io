            Your privacy is important to DIY GPS Tracker and it's creator:
            Csaba Toth. This privacy policy provides information about
            the personal data the application may collect or pass along, and the
            ways in which the related services use that personal data.

    <h5>Personal information collection</h5> 

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12">
            This app collects location data to make GPS tracking of your assets possible even when the app is closed or not in use. <strong>However</strong> the collection feeds into the user's own Firebase project. The creator's Firebase project doesn't receive any data whatsoever (it doesn't even have authentication enabled so collection would be impossible). <strong>All data is collected by the Firebase Project the user sets up and manages on its own</strong>, hence the term: Do-It-Youself (DIY).
        </div>
        <div class="col s12">
            During the usage of Firebase and Android services by the app Google may collect certain information (log in times and so on), but it is either essential part of the service (like logging in is a must), or it is out of the creator's jurisdiction or it is the responsibility of the user (once again: the user sets up their own Firestore and FCM messaging and they provision that). <strong>That is the whole cornerstone of the app bundle: YOU store YOUR OWN data and the creator does not have to touch (and does not even want to touch) anyone's sensitive data.</strong>

    <h5>Securing your data</h5> 

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12">
            The application uses standard methods and APIs to connect to, send data and receive data from the user's own managed Firebase Firestore and FCM. Please follow best-practices and secure your own data as much as you can since that's out of the creator's jurisdiction and the creator is not responsible for any damages. The app stores the password because the tracker device maybe in a position where the user cannot interact with it. In that case password login is the only way which can happen without user interaction (clicks, typing, and taps). The data stored in the preferences is encrypted by Jetpack Security feature.

            In some cases the information travels from the mobile apps to the cloud provider's servers the information is communicated through secure channels.

    <h5>Terms of Service</h5> 

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12">
            Since this app bundle's mindset is Do-It-Yourself, it requires and assumes technical expertise on the user's end, and since the user provisions their own data and parts of the system, the creator is not responsible for any damage or loss whatsoever caused by the app bundle. The app bundle doesn't have any guarantee about locating any trackable assets. The Android ecosystem can be complex, and even simple things like not turning off battery optimization for the tracker or if it's in the background could cause the tracking reporting to stop.
