            Your privacy is important to DIY GPS Tracker and it's creator:
            Csaba Toth. This privacy policy provides information about
            the personal information the application may collect or pass along, and the
            ways in which the related services use that personal information.

    <h5>Personal information collection</h5> 

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12">
            The application does not collect any personal information on it's own. The primary Firebase project associated to the apps don't
            receive any data (it doesn't even have authentication enabled), all data is collected by *the Firebase Project the user set up and manage* on their own. Hence the term: Do-It-Youself (DIY). During the usage of Firebase and Android services by the app Google may collect certain information, but it's either out of the creator's jurisdiction or it is the responsibility of the user (once again: the user sets up their own Firestore and FCM messaging and they provision that).

    <h5>Securing your data</h5> 

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12">
            The application uses standard methods and APIs to connect to, send data and receive data from the user's own managed Firebase Firestore and FCM. Please follow best-practices and secure your own data as much as you can since that's out of the creator's jurisdiction and the creator is not responsible for any damages. The SharedPreferences data is encrypted by Jetpack Security features.

            In some cases the information travels from the mobile apps to the cloud provider's servers the information is communicated through secure channels.

    <h5>Terms of Service</h5> 

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col s12">
            Since this app bundle's mindset is Do-It-Yourself, it requires and assumes technical expertise on the user's end, and since the user provisions their own data and parts of the system, the creator is not responsible for any damage or loss whatsoever caused by the app bundle. The app bundle doesn't have any guarantee about locating any trackable assets. The Android ecosystem can be complex, and even simple things like not turning off battery optimization for the tracker or if it's background could cause the tracking reporting to stop.

            Csaba Consulting customized that template to reflect the particular application instead of a website,
            and transformed it into HTML5/markdown format. The modified source is available on
